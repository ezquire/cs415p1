Usage
-----

To build the various task executables run
```
make
```

Then you can run the programs from the current directory
```
./taskx
```

Each task will generate one or more text files that can be used with the provided gnuplot scripts to make a scatterplot
```
euclid.txt
consec.txt
euclid2.txt
```

To generate the scatterplot graphs run
```
gnuplot scatterx.gnuplot
```

To clear the output files and executables use
```
make clean
```
